# hotel-Booking-PHP-Demo
Create a hotel booking registration form and connect it to a database for information storage. 

The demo is not 100% complete because I cannot figure out how to complete several tasks, including:
  1.) The hotel booking form does not complete validation, after the submit button is pressed, the form is automatically stored in the database. Although I   know that the validations are correct, because I am able to validate when the booking form is validated locally (w/o databse connected).
  
  2.) The delete button in formv does not delete any information in the database. When the 'delete' button is pressed, I receive the "successful deletion"   notification, but upon checking sql server, the information is still present 
  
  3.) The update button in formv does not do anything. After debugging for multiple hours, I was not able to see any changes in the code.
